# Event Ticketing System

## Overview
This project is a **ticket-event management system** built using **Go (Golang)** with **GORM** for database interactions, **PostgreSQL** as the database, **Redis** for caching / rate limiting, and **RabbitMQ** for message queuing.

### Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**
- **Event Creation & Management**
- **Ticket Booking System**
- **Database Schema Management (Migrations)**
- **Caching with Redis**
- **Message Queueing with RabbitMQ**
- **Dockerized Setup with `docker-compose`**

## Queue-Based Ticket Processing with RabbitMQ
This system leverages **RabbitMQ** as a **message queue** to handle ticket booking operations asynchronously.  

### **Why Use a Queue-Based System?**
- Prevents blocking the main API request/response cycle.
- Ensures **high availability** by handling **a large number of concurrent ticket bookings**.
- Provides **fault tolerance**â€”failed jobs can be **retried** without data loss.

### **How it Works**
1. When a user **books a ticket**, the request is **pushed into a queue** in RabbitMQ.
2. A **worker service** consumes the message **asynchronously** and processes the booking.
3. The worker **validates ticket availability** and stores booking details in the database.
4. A **confirmation email** is sent to the user upon successful booking.
